Ð¡alculate the minimal longest jump distance for given teleports
set and destination point from (0, 0, 0) point.

The main idea:

1. Initialize cluster with (0, 0, 0) point, set max_distance = 0;
2. while dest not in cluster:
   - pick closest to the cluster point, set max_distance = distance
     to this point (i.e. distance from this point to closest point
     in the cluster);
   - add recursively each point on distance = max_distance to the
     cluster;

Time complexity for current solution:
For each point in cluster we need to:
  1. find 1 closest point;
  2. find all points in radius.
Because everything is implemented right now as a linear search, this
give us O(n^2) time complexity.

The first improvement: use R-tree/KD-tree or some other structure for
spatial data wich could give better performance on this type of
lookups:
  1. Get all points in given radius.
  2. Get (1 or N?) closest points.

Here is a nice article about them:
https://blog.mapbox.com/a-dive-into-spatial-search-algorithms-ebd0c5e39d2a

The second: we could try to use binary search to find required distance.
In the worst case max distance = distance to Zearth. So we could try to
use binary search to find a min clusterization distance with which we
could reach Zearth. In this case we need only cheap queries of type
"get all points in radius".

Another improvement which could give better performance (not in terms
of asymptotic complexity but in terms of calculations efficiency):
We could use simplified distance metric and get rid of floating point
calculations. For example: distance = abs(x1 - x2) + abs(y1 - y2).
Instead of calculating standard euclidian distance through hypot/square
roots.
